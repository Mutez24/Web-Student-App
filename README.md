# Web-Student-App

The goal of this project was to create a simple CRUD application in JavaFX. This application allows us to create, retrieve, update and delete a student from/to the MySQL data base. This application follows the MVC design pattern by organizing the code into Model (Java classes), View (Fxml doc) and Controllers (Java classes).

For mor information about the application, please take a look a the pdf.
